To run this code you should just have to do
$ bash run.sh

but if that fails then you must manually compile the java source
$ javac *.java

Then run the simulation program. This will output to stdout by default. For
the gnuplot script to work you must redirect it to a file called "problem2.out"

$ java SIS_Static [data file] > problem2.out
which in my case is
$ java SIS_Static ../../datasets/static.network > problem2.out

Then you plot the results by calling the gnuplot command
$ gnuplot p2_plot.gnu

which will output a png line graph in a file called "p2.png"
